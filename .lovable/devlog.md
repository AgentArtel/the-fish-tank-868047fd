## 2026-06-13 — Vendor Watch: image perf + lightbox (Lovable / UI lane)

Follow-up to the Firecrawl hand-off earlier today.

### Problem
Thumbnails on `/vendor-watch/:sourceId` were loading full-resolution Shopify masters (1500–2500px, 300–800KB each). List view rendered 56×56 thumbs from these masters; grid view rendered 320×320. Both were slow.

### Fix
1. **Signed URL transforms** — `createSignedUrls` now passes `transform: { width: 320, height: 320, resize: "cover", quality: 70 }` so Supabase Storage serves webp thumbs (~95% smaller).
2. **Lazy + async decoding** — `loading="lazy"` + `decoding="async"` on every `<img>` so off-screen images don't fetch until scrolled near.
3. **Explicit dimensions** — `width`/`height` attributes on all `<img>` tags to prevent layout shift.
4. **Lightbox for full quality** — click any thumb → fixed overlay (`bg-black/80`) renders `object-contain` at `max-w-full max-h-full`. Opens instantly with the cached thumb, then a fresh full-quality signed URL (no transform, 1h expiry) is fetched and swapped in. Close by click or Escape. `Loader2` spinner while full-quality URL resolves.

### Files
- `src/routes/_app/vendor-watch.$sourceId.tsx` — thumbnail transforms, lazy loading, lightbox overlay.

### No migrations, no backend changes.

## 2026-06-10 — Coral loop E2E (browser automation lane)

Ran `handoff-coral-e2e.md` against the preview as admin `mbs.artel@gmail.com`. Test row: `ZZ E2E TEST CORAL 20260610T154255Z` @ plug `ZE9`, location **Live Sale Tank Test**, qty 1, no photo at capture (Variant B path forced by tooling — see note).

### Per-step results

- **0. Log in** — PASS. `/login` → `/dashboard`, no error toast. Minor: the email `<input>` ignores Playwright's `fill` (React-controlled input — value reverts to `''` and submit triggers HTML5 "Please fill out this field"). `type` (keystrokes) works. Not a product bug, but worth a `defaultValue` / uncontrolled fallback or a `data-testid` if we want this scriptable cleanly.
- **1. Discover + plug-tag** — PASS. Toast read **`Saved "ZZ E2E TEST CORAL 20260610T154255Z" @ ZE9 — add a photo later`** (matches the "no photo" variant string exactly). "Logged this session (1)" row shows `ZE9ʹ ×1 / For sale / Incoming`. Header counter flipped to **`1 plug tagged`**. No "already tagged" warning.
- **2. Verify safe draft** — PASS on the gates, **FAIL on the doc assertion that "the Plug column shows ZE9"**. `/inventory` (filtered `ZZ E2E`) shows columns Item / Vendor / Qty / Retail / Pricing / Location / Availability / Live sale. There is **no "Plug" column** on `routes/_app/inventory.index.tsx` at any viewport — `attrs.rack_position` is stored (proven by Step 3 below surfacing the `ZE9` badge in the Pricing Queue) but never rendered in the stock list. Other assertions held: Availability=**Incoming**, Pricing=**Not priced**, Retail=`—`, Live sale=**Not eligible**. → Decide: add a Plug column to `/inventory` for coral rows, or strike that bullet from the hand-off doc.
- **3. Approve pricing** — PASS. "Coral drafts — from Coral Discovery" section, ZE9 row, typed `45`, clicked **Approve**. Toast **`Pricing approved`**. Row flipped to **`$45.00 / Priced / Take live`**.
- **4. Take live (photo gate)** — Variant B PASS. **Take live** opened the `PhotoOnFileWizard` ("**Snap a photo on file**" — `ZZ E2E TEST CORAL … — Items must have at least one photo before they can be marked Available.`). This is exactly the take-live photo gate firing as designed (the trigger is `guard_inventory_photo_required` + the wizard guard). **Step did not complete** — see tooling note.
- **5. Public catalog** — **NOT RUN.** Requires the item to be `available`, which requires a photo upload, which the browser tool can't do (see note).
- **6. Teardown** — **N/A.** The test row never reached `available`, so it is not on `/catalog`. It still exists as an `incoming` draft named `ZZ E2E TEST CORAL 20260610T154255Z` (id discoverable by that exact name) and can be hard-deleted via DB cleanup if desired; no customer-visible exposure.
- **Variant A** — **NOT RUN.** Same tooling reason — Variant A's distinguishing step is uploading the photo at capture.

### Tooling limitation (root cause for the partial run)

Browser automation rejects file-input writes with `InvalidArgumentError: Failed to fill element (unsupported-input-type:file)` against both the coral-discovery capture input (`Tap to photograph the coral`) and the `PhotoOnFileWizard` input (`Tap to take a photo or choose a file`). I tried both label inputs after `observe()`-ing them — same error. This is a documented limitation ("complex file upload widgets may fail"), not a product bug. To finish Steps 4-final, 5, 6 and Variant A end-to-end, a human needs to drive the upload, or we add a server-fn shortcut (e.g. admin-only `attachInventoryPhotoFromUrl`) the test can call to seed a photo row.

### What a green-so-far run still proves

- Discovery captures + persists plug tags (`attrs.rack_position` → ZE9 badge in Pricing Queue).
- Discovery drafts are **never** auto-`available` — landed `incoming`, `Not priced`, retail null.
- Admin `approveInventoryPricing` works end-to-end (toast + row flip), gated by the new `guard_inventory_pricing_approval` trigger.
- The photo gate **fires** on take-live (wizard opens instead of completing) — Variant B's assertion.

### Action items for the team

1. **Decide on the Plug column** on `/inventory` (add, or update the hand-off doc).
2. **Human or scripted upload** to complete Steps 4-final → 6 and Variant A; ping when ready and I'll resume from Take live.
3. Optional DX: small login affordance so the email field is reliably scriptable (uncontrolled fallback, `name="email"`/autocomplete, or a `data-testid`).

## 2026-06-10 — DB hardening: admin-only inventory pricing approval (Lovable / DB lane)

Hand-off `handoff-coral-review.md` item 1 — shipped.

- New migration adds `public.guard_inventory_pricing_approval()` + `inv_guard_pricing_approval` trigger on `inventory_items`.
- **`BEFORE UPDATE OF pricing_status` only.** Fires when pricing is being changed *to* `approved` from a non-approved value by a non-admin → `RAISE EXCEPTION` (`check_violation`, "Only admins can approve inventory pricing"). INSERT path is intentionally untouched so Quick Add / bulk-import (non-admin editor restock that inserts items already `pricing_status='approved'`) keeps working.
- Function is `SECURITY DEFINER`, `search_path = public`, `EXECUTE` revoked from PUBLIC/anon/authenticated — trigger context only.
- Mirrors the existing `guard_vli_pricing_approval` pattern on vendor lines.

Hand-off item 2 — **confirmed, no change needed.** `inventory-media` bucket RLS (migration `20260526235115`) is path-agnostic: editor INSERT/SELECT/UPDATE policies only check `bucket_id` + `can_edit_content(auth.uid())`, so `coral-discovery/` (and any future prefix) is already covered, same as the working `quick-add/` prefix.

### Frontend review (PR #4, no DB dependency)
- `approveInventoryPricing` admin-gated in the server fn (`isAdmin` + `requireActive`) — consistent with the new DB trigger; trigger is defence-in-depth.
- "Take live" path goes through `setInventoryAvailability` → `available`, which still hits `inv_guard_gates` (price + retail + location + qty) and `guard_inventory_photo_required` (photo). Invariants intact.

### Linter / out-of-scope
- Migration introduced 0 new lint findings (new function is `EXECUTE`-revoked).
- 11 pre-existing warns remain (10× SECURITY DEFINER `EXECUTE` exposure on `has_role`, `is_active_user`, `can_edit_content`, `handle_new_user`, `log_inventory_activity`, `touch_updated_at`, and the four existing `guard_*` triggers; 1× `pg_trgm` in `public`). Not part of this hand-off — flag if you want a hardening pass.

## 2026-06-09 — Coral Inventory Discovery (capture tool)

Kicks off the "Next phase — Coral Inventory Discovery (manual)" item from below. The field-audit concluded a coral can be entered today with no migration; this turns that into a single purpose-built screen so a tank can be catalogued in one sitting instead of clicking through the generic Quick Add for every frag.

New `/inventory/coral-discovery` page (linked in the Inventory nav group, Waves icon):

- **System picker** lists coral-holding locations first (`coral_system / coral_flat / frag_tank / growout_tank / live_sale_tank / display_tank`), with a "Show all locations" toggle. Defaults to the first coral system (e.g. C-40100). Shows live coral count + per-role breakdown for the selected system.
- **Capture form** optimised for rapid repeated entry down a rack: optional camera photo, common name (autofocus), **plug / rack tag** (the 3D-printed plug codes — B3, X3, H8 — that mark exactly where a coral sits), scientific name, inventory role, coral type, optional price, quantity / frag count, notes. "Save & next" keeps the role + type set and refocuses the name field; an admin-free Clear resets everything.
- **Plug tagging** is the headline of the discovery workflow: the tag is normalized to uppercase, stored in `attrs.rack_position` (also added to the coral schema in `item-type-attrs.ts`, so it renders on the item detail page too), and the form warns if a plug is already tagged in the selected system so the same coral isn't logged twice. The system panel shows a live "N plugs tagged" count.
- **Session log** keeps a running list of what was logged this page-load (with plug codes); **"Already in this system"** shows existing corals in the picked location with their plug codes. Both deep-link to `/inventory/$id`.

### Invariants respected (review before live)

Discovery creates **draft** coral `inventory_items` only — it can never push a coral live on its own:

- `pricing_status` stays `not_priced` (discovery never approves pricing — admin still does).
- Nothing is set to `available` here. Role → draft availability: `for_sale → incoming`, `hold → on_hold`, `growout / mother_colony / frag_source → not_for_sale`. The intended role is recorded in `attrs.inventory_role` (and `attrs.coral_type`), matching the existing coral schema in `item-type-attrs.ts`.
- Photo is optional at capture (sets `needs_photo`), but the existing DB trigger still blocks `available` until a photo is on file — so the photo gate is preserved when an admin later promotes the item.

### Migrations

- None. Pure UI + two server fns on existing tables (`inventory_items`, `inventory_media`, `inventory_activity_logs`, `store_locations`).

### Files

- new `src/routes/_app/inventory.coral-discovery.tsx` — page, system picker, capture form (incl. plug/rack tag + duplicate warning), session log.
- edit `src/lib/ops.functions.ts` — `catalogCoralItem` (editor-gated draft create + plug tag + photo + activity log) and `getCoralDiscoveryOverview` (systems, per-location/role counts, plug positions in use, recent corals).
- edit `src/lib/item-type-attrs.ts` — `rack_position` field on the coral schema (shows on item detail page).
- edit `src/routes/_app.tsx` — "Coral Discovery" nav item under Inventory.

### What's next

1. Surface `inventory_role` as a column on `/inventory` when `type=coral` is filtered (small, code-only — the audit's optional step).
2. A reviewer pass to promote `incoming` for-sale corals (price + photo + availability) — could reuse the pricing queue once it covers inventory items, not just vendor lines.

## 2026-06-05 (Sprint 7) — Intake capture upgrades

Two long-standing intake pain points are closed: receiving a big shipment no longer requires line-by-line typing, and bulk-add no longer forces a single "shared" photo across heterogeneous rows.

Receive flow now has a **Scan** button on `ReceiveSection` that opens a camera-based ZXing reader (`@zxing/browser`). Each successful decode is matched case-insensitively against `vendor_line_items.vendor_item_id` on the current batch only; matches optionally `+1` the row's `received_quantity` (toggle in the scan dialog), toast-confirm, and smooth-scroll the matched `<tr id="receive-row-:id">` into view with a brief target highlight. Duplicate codes within 1.5s are debounced so a sticker held in frame doesn't double-count. Unknown codes are listed in the scan log so the receiver can spot mislabeled items without leaving the dialog.

Bulk-add (Quick Add → Create rows) now supports **per-row photos**. Each Create row gets its own photo slot; the existing shared photo picker stays but is re-labeled as the **fallback** used only for rows that don't pick their own. `bulkImportInventoryRows` server fn accepts optional `photo_path` + `photo_file_name` per row and prefers them over `shared_photo_path` at apply time. Per-row uploads run in parallel before the mutation fires.

### Planned vs shipped

| Plan item | Status |
|---|---|
| Barcode scan on receive (ZXing camera reader) | Done |
| Match by `vendor_item_id` within current batch (case-insensitive) | Done |
| Auto-increment `received_quantity` on match (toggleable) | Done |
| Scroll matched row into view + highlight | Done |
| Debounce duplicate codes in-frame | Done |
| Per-row photo on Quick Add Create rows | Done |
| Shared photo demoted to "fallback" role | Done |
| `bulkImportInventoryRows` accepts per-row `photo_path` | Done |
| Parallel per-row uploads | Done |
| `id={receive-row-${l.id}}` on receive `<tr>` for scroll targeting | Done |
| USB/Bluetooth HID barcode wedge support (no camera) | Deferred (covered today because most HID scanners type into a focused input, but we should still add a dedicated capture input next sprint) |
| Save scan history to DB for audit | Deferred (in-memory only; receive logs already capture the qty delta) |

### Migrations

- None. Pure UI + serverFn payload additions on existing tables.

### Files

- new `src/components/barcode-scan-dialog.tsx` — ZXing reader, debounce, match list, auto-increment toggle.
- edit `src/components/quick-add-fab.tsx` — `RowPhotoSlot`, parallel uploads, shared-as-fallback wording.
- edit `src/lib/ops.functions.ts` — `bulkImportInventoryRows` accepts `photo_path` / `photo_file_name` per row.
- edit `src/routes/_app/batches.$id.tsx` — Scan button on `ReceiveSection`, `onMatch` handler, `id="receive-row-:id"` + `scroll-mt-24 target:bg-amber-50` for scroll targeting.
- add dep `@zxing/browser`.

### What's next (mirrors roadmap)

1. Sprint 8 — Per-type fields (coral / dry_good / fish JSONB `attrs`) + pricing approval queue.
2. Sprint 9 — AI parsing bring-your-own key (OpenAI / Gemini), fallback to Lovable AI Gateway.
3. Sprint 10 — Static + browser automation audit, then Clover POS read-sync.
4. Sprint 7 follow-up — HID barcode wedge input + persisted scan history for receive audit.

## 2026-06-05 (Sprint 6 · part 2) — Public `/catalog` route

Customers (and anyone with a scanned label URL) can now browse what's in stock without signing in. New top-level `/catalog` route, no auth gate, SSR. Pulls `availability_status='available'` items that have `quantity_available > 0`, `retail_price > 0`, and at least one photo on file — same trust gate the photo-on-file wizard already enforces. Accepts the exact same `?location=`, `?descendants=1`, `?type=` query params as `/inventory`, so QR labels printed for staff also work as public catalog deep links. Includes debounced search by name / scientific name, type filter, active-filter chips, and lazy-loaded image grid.

Server function `getPublicCatalog` is unauthenticated and uses `supabaseAdmin` (dynamic import inside the handler) with a tightly scoped projection — no wholesale cost, no vendor, no internal status fields ever leave the server. Photos are returned as 1-hour signed URLs, preferring `website` > `social`/`live_sale` > `internal` tag when an item has multiple shots.

### Planned vs shipped

| Plan item | Status |
|---|---|
| Public `/catalog` route, no auth, SSR-friendly | Done |
| `getPublicCatalog` server fn (admin client, sanitized projection) | Done |
| Filters: search, type, location (+ descendants), URL-driven | Done |
| Photo-first grid; items without photos are hidden | Done |
| Reuses QR label format from Sprint 6 · part 1 (zero label changes) | Done |
| SEO head() with og:title / og:description / twitter tags | Done |
| Customer-facing QR variant pointing at `/catalog` | Deferred (existing labels work; revisit if shop wants outward-facing signage) |

### Migrations

- None. Pure read path through `supabaseAdmin` with safe column projection.

### Files

- new `src/lib/catalog.functions.ts` — `getPublicCatalog` server fn (admin client, descendant resolver, signed-URL batching).
- new `src/routes/catalog.tsx` — public route, validateSearch, filter UI, photo grid, og tags.

### What's next (mirrors roadmap)

1. Sprint 7 — Intake capture upgrades (barcode scan on receive, bulk-add per-row photo).
2. Sprint 8 — Per-type fields (coral/dry_good/fish) + pricing approval queue.
3. Sprint 9 — AI parsing bring-your-own key (OpenAI / Gemini).
4. Sprint 10 — Static + browser automation audit, then Clover POS sync.

## 2026-06-05 (Sprint 6 · part 1) — QR deep-linking on `/inventory`

Printed QR labels now actually do something useful when scanned. `/inventory` accepts `?location=:uuid`, `?descendants=1`, and `?type=:itemType` search params, filters the list server-side, and shows clearable filter chips with the resolved location name + a one-click toggle to include sub-locations. The QR label generator on `/store-locations` encodes `descendants=1` automatically for container kinds (zone/room/rack/shelf/freezer/cooler) so scanning a "Coral Room" label shows everything inside it, not just items directly tagged to the room itself.

### Planned vs shipped

| Plan item | Status |
|---|---|
| `validateSearch` on `/inventory` with zod (`location`, `descendants`, `type`) | Done |
| Filter inventory query by `location_id` (single or via `IN (descendants)`) | Done |
| Filter inventory query by `item_type` | Done |
| Active-filter chips with location name + clear + toggle descendants | Done |
| Empty-state copy adapts when filters are active | Done |
| QR label URL encodes `&descendants=1` for container kinds | Done |
| Public `/catalog` route | Deferred to Sprint 6 · part 2 |
| Barcode scan on receive | Sprint 7 |

### Migrations

- None.

### Files

- edited `src/routes/_app/inventory.index.tsx` — validateSearch, descendant resolver, filter chips, type filter, shared locations query.
- edited `src/routes/_app/store-locations.tsx` — QR URL includes `&descendants=1` for container kinds.

### What's next (mirrors roadmap)

1. Sprint 6 · part 2 — Public `/catalog` (read-only, no auth, available items with photos).
2. Sprint 7 — Intake capture upgrades (barcode scan on receive, bulk-add per-row photo).
3. Sprint 8 — Per-type fields (coral/dry_good/fish) + pricing approval queue.
4. Sprint 9 — AI parsing bring-your-own key (OpenAI / Gemini).
5. Sprint 10 — Static + browser automation audit, then Clover POS sync.



## 2026-06-05 (Sprint 5) — Dashboard stock value by category

Owner wanted a glance-level read on where money is tied up. Replaced the single "Stock value" KPI on `/dashboard` with a category breakdown: Livestock (fish + invert + live_rock), Coral, and Dry goods (dry_good + equipment). Total + "Other" footnote shown in the section header. Aggregation done server-side in `getShopOverview` to keep it cheap.

### Planned vs shipped

| Plan item | Status |
|---|---|
| Extend `getShopOverview` to return per-category stock value | Done |
| Replace single "Stock value" KPI with Livestock / Coral / Dry goods row | Done |
| Keep total stock value visible (now section subtitle + "Total stock value" KPI in glance row) | Done |
| Link each category KPI to `/inventory` (deep-link by `?type=` lands in Sprint 6) | Done |

### Migrations

- None.

### Files

- edited `src/routes/_app/dashboard.tsx` — server fn aggregates by `item_type`; new "Stock value by category" section.

### What's next (mirrors roadmap)

1. Sprint 6 — QR deep-linking + customer-facing catalog (`?location=`, `?type=`, public `/catalog`).
2. Sprint 7 — Intake capture upgrades (barcode scan on receive, bulk-add per-row photo).
3. Sprint 8 — Per-type fields (coral/dry_good/fish) + pricing approval queue.
4. Sprint 9 — AI parsing bring-your-own key (OpenAI / Gemini).
5. Sprint 10 — Static + browser automation audit, then Clover POS sync.

## 2026-06-05 (Sprint 3) — Photo-on-file wizard

When someone tries to flip an item to Available without a photo on file, a modal now intercepts the change, captures a single photo (camera on mobile, file on desktop), uploads it, and then completes the availability change automatically. Works from both the inventory list row and the item detail page; the existing DB trigger (`guard_inventory_photo_required`) remains the source of truth.

### Planned vs shipped

| Plan item | Status |
|---|---|
| Reusable `PhotoOnFileWizard` dialog (camera capture, preview, retake, has-price-tag flag) | Done |
| `inventoryHasPhoto(id)` helper (single round-trip check) | Done |
| Intercept Availability → "Available" on inventory detail `ControlsCard` | Done |
| Intercept Availability → "Available" on inventory list row | Done |
| Auto-clear `needs_photo` + best-effort OCR on upload | Done |
| Apply pending availability change after successful upload | Done |

### Migrations

- None. Storage bucket + RLS + photo-required trigger were already in place.

### Files

- created `src/components/photo-on-file-wizard.tsx` — modal + `inventoryHasPhoto` helper.
- edited `src/routes/_app/inventory.$id.tsx` — `ControlsCard` gates availability changes through the wizard.
- edited `src/routes/_app/inventory.index.tsx` — `InventoryRow` gates availability changes through the wizard.

### What's next (mirrors roadmap)

1. Sprint 4 — Missing-price-tag export (CSV / printable sheet).
2. Filter Inventory page by `?location=:id` so QR labels actually deep-link.
3. Full audit pass via browser automation, tracked in an audit doc.
4. Own-API-key option for AI parsing.
5. Barcode scan on receive (getUserMedia + ZXing).
6. Customer-facing inventory search.

## 2026-06-05 (Sprint 2.5) — Roles + location mapping polish

Extended the role system so invites/role-assignment cover staff and viewers, and rebuilt the Store Locations page into a visual map: thumbnails, photo gallery per location, breadcrumb path, item counts, inline rename, reorder, and printable QR labels.

### Planned vs shipped

| Plan item | Status |
|---|---|
| Add `manager`, `staff`, `viewer` to `app_role` enum | Done |
| Treat `manager` as editor in `can_edit_content` | Done |
| `setUserRole` server fn + RoleSelect with descriptions | Done |
| Invite + active-user role dropdowns include all 6 roles | Done |
| `store_location_media` table + bucket RLS (`media/store-locations/*`) | Done |
| Photo gallery dialog (multi-upload, set primary, delete) | Done |
| Thumbnail rendered in tree row | Done |
| Breadcrumb path on each node | Done |
| Direct + subtree item count badge | Done |
| Inline rename (double-click) | Done |
| Up/down reorder siblings via `sort_order` | Done |
| Printable QR labels (one per active location, links to `/inventory?location=:id`) | Done |
| Delete location action in edit dialog | Done (extra) |

### Migrations

- `20260605020*_extend_role_enum_locations.sql` — `app_role` += manager/staff/viewer; `store_locations.sort_order`, `store_locations.primary_photo_url`; new `store_location_media` table + RLS; storage policies for `media/store-locations/*`.
- `20260605020*_can_edit_manager.sql` — `can_edit_content` now grants editor to `manager`.

### Files

- edited `src/lib/cms.functions.ts` — `ROLE_ENUM`, `setUserRole`, expanded enums on `approveUser`/`inviteUser`.
- edited `src/lib/ops.ts` — `APP_ROLES`, `APP_ROLE_LABELS`, `APP_ROLE_DESCRIPTIONS`.
- rewrote `src/routes/_app/settings.users.tsx` — `RoleSelect` w/ inline descriptions, role-change for active users.
- rewrote `src/routes/_app/store-locations.tsx` — tree thumbnails, breadcrumbs, counts, reorder, inline rename, `PhotoDialog`, `PrintLabelsButton`.
- added dep: `qrcode` (+ `@types/qrcode`).

### What's next (mirrors roadmap)

1. Sprint 3 — Photo-on-file wizard (single-photo intake for items already on the floor without a vendor batch).
2. Filter Inventory page by `?location=:id` so QR labels actually deep-link.
3. Drag-and-drop reorder + cross-parent move (current is up/down within siblings only).

---

## 2026-06-05 (Sprint 2) — Bulk paste import with dedupe


Pasted lists now go through a dedupe pass before insert. Each row is tagged New / Likely dup / Exact match against existing inventory; the user can choose Create new, Add qty to existing, or Skip per row, and apply all decisions in a single server call.

### Planned vs shipped

| Plan item | Status |
|---|---|
| `findInventoryDuplicates` server fn — name + scientific-name scoring vs existing items | Done |
| `bulkImportInventoryRows` server fn — atomic-ish per-row create / merge / skip, editor-gated | Done |
| Reuses today's Quick Add batch (same as single Quick Add) | Done |
| Merge path increments `quantity_available` + `quantity_received` and stamps notes | Done |
| Reviewable grid: per-row decision dropdown, candidate name + score + qty + price shown | Done |
| Shared photo required only when ≥1 row is set to Create | Done |
| Tally line ("X create · Y merge · Z skip") + summary toast on apply | Done |
| Vendor + location pickers apply to all rows | Done (existing) |

### Migrations

- None (pg_trgm already enabled in Sprint 1.6; scoring uses the same token-overlap helper as reconciliation).

### Files

- edited `src/lib/ops.functions.ts` — appended `findInventoryDuplicates` + `bulkImportInventoryRows`.
- edited `src/components/quick-add-fab.tsx` — rewrote `MarkdownBulk` with dedupe pass, per-row decision UI, and single-call bulk apply.

### What's next (unchanged order)

1. Sprint 3 — One-time photo-on-file wizard the first time an item is made Available.
2. Sprint 4 — Missing-price-tag export (CSV / printable sheet).
3. Full audit pass via browser automation.
4. Own-API-key option for AI parsing.
5. Barcode scan on receive.

## 2026-06-05 (later) — UX polish: mobile sidebar + flexible location nesting

Two setup-quality issues blocking real use of the app on the floor.

### Planned vs shipped

| Plan item | Status |
|---|---|
| Mobile-collapsible sidebar (Sheet drawer + hamburger top bar; desktop unchanged) | Done |
| Auto-close mobile drawer on route change | Done |
| Allow arbitrary nesting in `store_locations` (room → freezer → shelf → bin, etc.) | Done |
| New location kinds: `room`, `rack`, `shelf`, `bin`, `freezer`, `cooler` | Done |
| Recursive tree UI with expand/collapse + "Add inside" on container kinds | Done |
| Parent picker excludes self + own descendants (cycle-safe) | Done |

### Migrations

- `20260605_*` — `ALTER TYPE store_location_kind ADD VALUE` for room, rack, shelf, bin, freezer, cooler.

### Files

- edited `src/lib/ops.ts` — extended `STORE_LOCATION_KINDS`/labels, added `STORE_LOCATION_CONTAINER_KINDS`.
- rewrote `src/routes/_app/store-locations.tsx` — recursive tree, generalized dialog (any container can be a parent).
- edited `src/routes/_app.tsx` — extracted `SidebarBody`, desktop `aside` hidden on mobile, mobile `Sheet` drawer with hamburger header.

### What's next (unchanged order)

1. Sprint 2 — Bulk paste import with dedupe (next).
2. Sprint 3 — Photo wizard for Quick Add (camera-first capture).
3. Sprint 4 — Missing-tag export (printable list of inventory needing labels).

## 2026-06-05 — Sprint 1.6: Attach-PO-later reconciliation for Quick Add batches

When a restock is logged via Quick Add and the vendor PO/invoice shows up later, the user can now upload it onto the same batch and reconcile extracted PO lines against the inventory items they already created on the floor.

### Planned vs shipped

| Plan item | Status |
|---|---|
| Mark new Quick Add batches with `is_quick_add=true` (back-fill existing) | Done |
| `vendor_line_items.reconciliation_status` + `reconciled_inventory_item_id` + `reconciliation_notes` | Done |
| `promoteQuickAddBatchVendor` server fn (editor-gated, reassigns vendor on batch + on QA inventory items) | Done |
| `computeQuickAddReconciliation` server fn (token-overlap name match + scientific-name fallback, returns confirmed / suggested / unmatched PO / unmatched inv) | Done |
| `confirmReconciliation` server fn (matches, accept-PO-line, flag-missing, flag-extra; respects `inventory_items.source_vendor_line_item_id` UNIQUE) | Done |
| `ReconcileSection` UI on batch detail (visible only when `is_quick_add=true`) | Done |
| Vendor promotion combobox at top of section | Done |
| Reuse existing `extractBatchWithAI` for PO PDF parsing (no separate attach fn needed) | Done |
| pg_trgm extension enabled for future fuzzy queries | Done |

### Migrations

- `20260605_*_quick_add_po_reconciliation` — `vendor_batches.is_quick_add`, three `vendor_line_items` reconciliation columns + check constraint + index, back-fill of existing quick-add batches, `pg_trgm` extension.

### Files

- `src/lib/ops.functions.ts` — `promoteQuickAddBatchVendor`, `computeQuickAddReconciliation`, `confirmReconciliation`; `quickAddInventoryItem` + `getOrCreateQuickAddBatch` now set `is_quick_add: true`.
- `src/components/reconcile-section.tsx` — new section component with VendorPromote + ReconcileMatcher.
- `src/routes/_app/batches.$id.tsx` — import + render `<ReconcileSection>` above line items.

### Notes / decisions

- Matching is in-process JS (normalized token overlap + scientific-name fallback) since both sets are small per-batch. `pg_trgm` is installed for future use (e.g. searching across batches).
- Activity log uses `action: "updated"` with a `"PO line matched to Quick Add inventory item"` summary — the existing activity-action enum doesn't include a `reconciled` value and we didn't widen it this sprint.
- `confirmReconciliation` is idempotent: it re-runs the same selections safely, skipping items already linked to other lines.
- "Flag extras" appends a dated note to the inventory item rather than blocking it — it stays sellable.

## 2026-06-04 (late) — Sprint 1.5: Quick Add discoverability + vendor on the fly

Unblocking restock-as-you-go: empty inventory page hid the FAB, and Quick Add couldn't capture vendor.

### Shipped

| Area | Change |
|---|---|
| Quick Add FAB | Exported new `QuickAddButton` (inline-friendly variant), kept floating `QuickAddFab` unchanged. |
| Quick Add forms | Added `VendorPickerCombo` (searchable, quick-create) to Manual and Markdown bulk paths. |
| Server fn | New `quickCreateVendor` (editor-gated, slug auto-gen, case-insensitive dedupe). |
| Server fn | Extended `quickAddInventoryItem` input with optional `source_vendor_id`; writes to `inventory_items.vendor_id` so restocked items record actual source instead of the "quick-add" batching vendor. |
| Inventory list | Header-right `Quick Add` button + real empty state with `Quick add an item` and `Open vendor batches` actions. |

### Files

- `src/lib/ops.functions.ts` — added `quickCreateVendor`, extended `quickAddInventoryItem`.
- `src/components/quick-add-fab.tsx` — `QuickAddButton`, `VendorPickerCombo`, vendor state threading.
- `src/routes/_app/inventory.index.tsx` — header button + empty state.

No schema migration — used existing `vendors` + `inventory_items.vendor_id` columns.

---

## 2026-06-04 — Sprint 1: OCR / image tagging on photo upload

### Planned
| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Extend `parseTagPhoto` to return raw label text + auto-detected `has_price_tag` | Done |
| Cache OCR results on `inventory_media` (`ocr_text`, `ocr_extracted_at`) | Done |
| Auto-run OCR on each new photo uploaded in inventory detail Media section | Done |
| "Re-run AI extraction" button per image tile | Done |
| Surface OCR'd text + `tag ✓` badge in media tiles | Done |
| Quick Add FAB already wired to `parseTagPhoto` (no change needed) | Verified |

### Migrations
- `*_inventory_media_ocr_cache` — add `ocr_text`, `ocr_extracted_at` to `inventory_media`

### Notes
- OCR runs best-effort on upload (failures don't block the upload, just skip).
- `has_price_tag` is auto-set from AI detection — overrides the upload-form checkbox when AI is confident.

---


## 2026-06-04 — DOA enforcement, audit trail, Quick Add

### Planned (from earlier asks today)
- Audit trail for each receive action (received qty, lost qty, location, 3× retail) with timestamp + user
- DOA toast prompting mandatory in-bag and on-lid photos (wholesaler requirement)
- Server-side enforcement of DOA photo requirement
- Quick Add for restocking livestock + dry goods (photo / markdown / manual)
- Missing-photo prompt across the app

### Shipped
- `vendor_line_receive_logs` table — full audit row per receive action (actor, timestamp, before/after of received, lost, reason, location, override retail)
- `vendor_line_doa_photos` table + `guard_vli_doa_photos` trigger — DB-level block on DOA tag without both `in_bag` and `on_lid` photos
- `receiveBatchLines` server pre-check — atomic fail before any writes if any DOA line is missing required photos
- DOA capture UI on batch detail with toast prompts
- Quick Add FAB in global `_app` layout → `getOrCreateQuickAddBatch` (one batch per user per day under auto-vendor `quick-add`)
- `quickAddInventoryItem` server fn — creates vendor_batch + inventory_item + inventory_media in one shot
- `parseTagPhoto` (Gemini 2.5 Flash vision) — extracts name / scientific name / type / retail price from a tag or label photo
- `parseInventoryMarkdown` — bulk markdown → reviewable grid → bulk insert
- `inventory_media.has_price_tag` flag on primary photos
- `guard_inventory_photo_required` trigger — blocks `availability_status='available'` without ≥1 photo
- Missing-photo banner on `inventory.$id` (red when item is "Available", amber otherwise)

### Migrations
- `20260604222946_*` — receive audit log + DOA photos table
- `20260604223452_*` — DOA photo guard trigger
- `20260604224211_*` — quick-add vendor + inventory photo guard + `has_price_tag`

---

## 2026-06-03 — Intake foundation (from `.lovable/plan.md`)

### Planned vs. shipped
| Plan item | Status |
|---|---|
| `item_type` enum on vendor_line_items + inventory_items | Done |
| `suggested_retail_3x` generated column (wholesale × 3) | Done |
| `received_at` / `received_by` on inventory_items | Done |
| `store_locations` — `parent_location_id` + `zone` kind | Done |
| `received_quantity` / `lost_quantity` / `loss_reason` / `assigned_location_id` on vendor_line_items | Done |
| `listLocationsTree` server fn | Done |
| `upsertLocation` server fn | Done |
| `receiveBatchLines` server fn (editor-gated, atomic per-row) | Done |
| `convertLineItemsToInventory` extended (copies type, location, received_at/by) | Done |
| `inviteUser` admin-only via `supabaseAdmin.auth.admin.inviteUserByEmail` | Done |
| Settings → Locations page (zone/tank tree, add/edit) | Done — built as `/_app/store-locations` (flat route) |
| Settings → Users invite modal | Done |
| Batch detail "Receive shipment" mode (qty, lost, reason, location, 3× retail, override) | Done |
| Safety rules preserved (no AI write to pricing/review/inventory) | Done |
| Roadmap memory file | Done — `mem://features/intake-roadmap` |

### Migrations
- `20260603181448_*` — earlier intake schema baseline
- `20260603202651_*` — item_type enum, zones, receive columns, suggested_retail_3x

---

## What's next (ordered)

From `mem://features/intake-roadmap` — kept in sync as items ship:

1. Sprint 2 — Bulk paste import with dedupe (from earlier roadmap of feature sprints)
2. Sprint 3 — One-time photo-on-file wizard the first time an item is made Available
3. Sprint 4 — Missing-price-tag export (CSV / printable sheet of items without a tag photo)
4. Full audit pass using browser automation, tracked in an audit doc
5. Own-API-key option for AI parsing (user-provided OPENAI/GEMINI key preferred over `LOVABLE_API_KEY`)
6. Barcode scan on receive (`getUserMedia` + ZXing) → `vendor_item_id` lookup
7. Customer-facing inventory search (public read-only catalog filtered by `availability='available'`)
8. Per-type fields: coral fragging metadata, dry-good SKU/UPC, fish size/sex/age
9. Pricing approval queue showing market-rate overrides with reason
10. Bulk-add: per-row photo upload instead of a single shared photo
11. Clover POS sync — out of scope until inventory flow is stable


## Standing rules (in force)
- AI cannot approve pricing, mark review approved, convert to inventory, or create `inventory_items`
- All mutating server fns gated by `requireEditor` or admin-only check
- Convert requires `review=approved` AND `pricing=approved` AND admin role
- Inventory item cannot be `available` without at least one photo (DB trigger)
- DOA tag requires both in-bag and on-lid photos (DB trigger + server pre-check)

## Sprint 8 — Per-type fields (2026-06-05)

**Planned:** JSONB per-type attributes + pricing approval queue polish.

**Shipped:**
| Area | Change |
|---|---|
| Schema | `inventory_items.attrs jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'`, same on `vendor_line_items`; GIN indexes for lookup |
| Schema definitions | `src/lib/item-type-attrs.ts` — per-type field groups for fish (care/swim zone/reef-safe), coral (type/lighting/flow/placement/aggression), invert, live_rock, dry_good (brand/SKU/UPC/expiry), equipment (brand/model/serial/wattage/warranty), other |
| UI | `src/components/attrs-editor.tsx` — schema-driven form (text/number/select/boolean); dirty-state save button |
| UI | `PerTypeCard` on `/inventory/:id` with item-type selector + auto-loaded fields |
| Server | `updateInventoryAttrs`, `updateInventoryItemType` server fns (editor-gated, zod-validated) |
| Pricing queue | `/pricing-approval` was already shipped — admin-gated approve, hooked to `approveLinePricing` |

**Deferred (Sprint 8 follow-up):** vendor line item per-type editor during intake review, expose `attrs` on `/catalog` projection, server-side filters on `/inventory` by attribute (e.g. `?attr.reef_safe=yes`).

---

## Sprint 9 — Bring-Your-Own AI keys

The whole intake stack (`aiExtractInvoice`, `parseTagPhoto`, `parseInventoryMarkdown`) hard-coded the Lovable AI Gateway. That meant any rate limit, credit issue, or "use my own paid OpenAI quota" preference forced us to redeploy. Sprint 9 fixes that without changing any feature behavior.

### What shipped

| Layer | Change |
|---|---|
| DB | `workspace_ai_settings` (singleton, admin-only RLS, GRANT/RLS/trigger), seeded with `provider='lovable'` so existing code paths keep working |
| Helper | `src/lib/ai-call.server.ts` — `callAIChat({ tier, lovableModel, messages, tools, tool_choice })` resolves provider → OpenAI (`api.openai.com`) / Gemini (OpenAI-compat `generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai`) / Lovable Gateway, surfaces upstream status as `e.status`, optionally falls back to Lovable, and records `last_used_at/provider/error` |
| Server fns | `getAISettings` (masked), `updateAISettings` (clear-with-empty-string, leave-alone-with-undefined), `testAISettings` (ping → "pong") — all admin-gated via `requireAdmin` |
| Refactor | All three AI call sites now use `callAIChat` with explicit `tier: "pro"` for invoice extraction and `tier: "flash"` for label/list parsing; user-facing errors mention Settings → AI |
| UI | `/settings/ai` admin page: provider switch (locks providers without a stored key), masked-key inputs with "leave blank to keep existing" semantics, per-tier model overrides, fallback toggle, **Send test ping** button, last-call/last-error panel |
| Nav | Added "AI keys" entry under Settings, admin-only |

### Security posture

Keys live in `workspace_ai_settings`, RLS = admin-only. The Data API never returns raw keys to non-admins. `getAISettings` returns masked values (first 4 + last 4). The settings table is touched only via `supabaseAdmin` from server fns that themselves run `requireAdmin(supabase, userId)` — so a non-admin can't bypass the masking via the server fn either. The new `last_error` column avoids leaking the key itself — only the upstream response status / message snippet.

### Deferred (Sprint 9 follow-up)

- Per-feature provider override (e.g. always Gemini Pro for invoices regardless of default provider)
- Persisted AI usage log (per call: feature, provider, model, tokens, latency, cost estimate)
- Show fallback warnings inline in the UI when an intake call quietly fell back to Lovable

## Facility Mapping — LOCKED (2026-06-06)

The `store_locations` tree is now the **source of truth** for the physical shop. No further structural changes without a new mapping cycle.

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Facility map seeded (Migration B + correction migration) | Done |
| Official names / kinds / aliases corrected | Done |
| Parent/child hierarchy verified (Migration C unnecessary — already wired) | Done |
| Zones mapped: Retail Floor, Showroom (Support / Fish Systems / Coral Systems / Display Systems), Quarantine, Warehouse/Storage | Done |
| Fish-system towers (S-2000/3000/4000/5000 → T1..T4) parented correctly | Done |
| Coral growout (C-40100..40400) as leaves under Coral Systems | Done |
| Planned QT towers (Q-30400, Q-30500) remain `planned=true, is_active=false` | Done |
| 3 original seed rows untouched | Done |
| 8 existing inventory assignments unchanged | Done |
| `system_group_id` correct on fish systems | Done |

**Standing rule:** no Clover sync, no storage-unit work, no bulk automation until the next phase explicitly approves it.

---

## Next phase — Coral Inventory Discovery (manual)

First target system: **C-40100 — LPS Growout Tank** (alias: Big Frag Tank).

Workflow (manual, no automation yet):

1. Identify coral system (start with C-40100)
2. Capture photos / short videos
3. Record coral name if known (common + scientific)
4. Record **sale status**: `for_sale | not_for_sale | growout | mother_colony | frag_source | hold`
5. Record price if known
6. Record quantity / frag count if applicable
7. Assign `location_id` from the existing `store_locations` tree
8. Prepare a clean review batch — **no inserts** until reviewed

**Out of scope for this phase:** Clover sync, bulk import automation, dry goods, fish, storage units.

---

## Coral Inventory Intake — current-state field audit

Question: can a coral item be entered cleanly **today** via the Workspace, without schema or UI changes?

### What is already covered by `inventory_items`

| Need | Field today | OK? |
|---|---|---|
| Coral common name | `item_name` | ✅ |
| Scientific name | `scientific_name` | ✅ |
| Item type = coral | `item_type` enum includes `coral` | ✅ |
| Location | `location_id` → `store_locations` (C-40100 exists) | ✅ |
| Price | `retail_price` + `pricing_status` (admin-approved) | ✅ |
| Quantity / frag count | `quantity_received` / `quantity_available` (numeric) | ✅ |
| Photos / video | `inventory_media` table + Photo-on-File wizard | ✅ |
| Notes | `notes` | ✅ |
| Vendor / lineage source | `vendor_id`, `source_vendor_line_item_id`, `source_vendor_batch_id` | ✅ |
| Per-type coral attrs (type/lighting/flow/placement/aggression/frag size/aquacultured) | `attrs` JSONB + `coral` schema in `src/lib/item-type-attrs.ts` | ✅ |
| Receive metadata | `received_at`, `received_by` | ✅ |

### Sale-status mapping — partial gap

The requested sale-status vocabulary maps onto **two** existing dimensions:

| Requested value | Maps to today | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `for_sale` | `availability_status = 'available'` | Requires photo + approved price + location (existing guards) |
| `not_for_sale` | `availability_status = 'not_for_sale'` | ✅ |
| `hold` | `availability_status = 'on_hold'` | ✅ |
| `growout` | ❌ no enum value | Could be stored as `availability_status='not_for_sale'` + `attrs.inventory_role='growout'` |
| `mother_colony` | ❌ no enum value | Same — needs an inventory-role concept |
| `frag_source` | ❌ no enum value | Same — needs an inventory-role concept |

**Inventory role** is the missing concept. `availability_status` answers "can a customer buy it?" but the coral-discovery workflow also needs to record **why** a non-saleable colony is in the system (growout vs mother vs frag source).

### Recommendation

**Coral inventory CAN be entered today**, with one small caveat:

- For `for_sale` / `not_for_sale` / `hold` → use existing `availability_status` directly.
- For `growout` / `mother_colony` / `frag_source` → record under `attrs.inventory_role` (free text) until a dedicated UI is built. The coral attrs editor (`PerTypeCard` on `/inventory/:id`) already renders arbitrary attr fields, so we can extend the coral schema in `src/lib/item-type-attrs.ts` with a single select field — **code-only change, no migration**.

**Tiny pre-work proposed before discovery starts (≤30 min):**

1. Add `inventory_role` select to `coral` schema in `src/lib/item-type-attrs.ts` with options `for_sale | growout | mother_colony | frag_source | hold` (mirrors the workflow vocabulary; `availability_status` handles the customer-facing toggle).
2. Optional: surface `inventory_role` as a column on `/inventory` when `type=coral` is filtered.

No DB migration. No Clover. No bulk import. Discovery can begin on C-40100 immediately after step 1.

## 2026-06-10 — Vendor scrape system, Phase 1 (Lovable)

Shipped the multi-vendor scraping foundation. Sea Dwelling's "Furnace" is wired up end-to-end.

**Migration** (`20260610_vendor_scrapes`)
- Added `'scrape'` to `vendor_batch_source_document_type` enum.
- New tables `vendor_scrape_sources` (admin-managed) + `vendor_scrape_items` (editor-managed). RLS + grants in same migration. 0 new lint findings.
- Seeded `Sea Dwelling Creatures` vendor + Furnace source (`shop.seadwelling.com/collections/the-furnace/products.json`, cadence `friday_night` — informational only in Phase 1).

**Server fns** (`src/lib/scrape.functions.ts`)
- `listScrapeSources` (editor) — sources + counts (new / available / imported).
- `getScrapeSource` (editor) — source + items, status-filtered.
- `refreshScrapeSource` (**admin**) — paginates Shopify products.json, upserts items keyed on variant SKU, downloads photos to `inventory-media/scraped/<vendor-slug>/<sku>.<ext>` via `supabaseAdmin` (loaded inside handler, never at module scope), marks no-longer-seen items `available_at_source=false`.
- `importScrapeItems` (editor) — creates draft `vendor_batch` (`source_document_type='scrape'`, `intake_status='review'`) + `vendor_line_item` per pick with `wholesale_cost`, `item_type` (guessed from tags, default `coral`), `pricing_status='not_priced'`, and `attrs.{scrape_source_id, scrape_item_id, photo_path, photo_source_url, product_url, vendor_tags}`. Suggested 3× retail comes from the existing generated column. Lands in Pricing Queue; admin still approves.
- `setScrapeItemStatus` (editor) — ignore/unignore. Refuses to overwrite `imported`.

**UI**
- `/vendors/scrape` — sources list with counts + last-scrape time.
- `/vendors/scrape/$sourceId` — picker: filter by status (new/imported/ignored/unavailable/all), thumbnails via short-lived signed URLs, bulk Import → navigates to the new batch in `/batches/$id`, bulk Ignore/Restore. "Refresh now" button is admin-only at the server layer.
- Sidebar link "Vendor Scrapes" under Inventory.

**Invariants preserved**
- AI/scrape is draft-only ✅ — lines land `not_priced`, batch starts `review`.
- Admin-only pricing approval ✅ — flows through existing `guard_vli_pricing_approval` trigger.
- Photo gate ✅ — photo stored at scrape time on `vendor_scrape_items.photo_path`; conversion to inventory still has to attach it for go-live.
- Mutating fns gated on `is_active` + role ✅.

**Deferred to Phase 2-4** (separate hand-offs)
- Phase 2: per-source `pg_cron` (Furnace = Friday 22:00). Route stub will live at `/api/public/hooks/scrape-vendor`.
- Phase 3: `vendor_source_watches` table + alerts when a name pattern goes available.
- Phase 4: authed vendors (cookie/basic/bearer auth_method already in schema), Firecrawl fallback for non-Shopify, per-vendor secret slots.

**For Claude Code (review checklist)**
- Verify `attrs.photo_path` on scraped vendor_line_items is picked up by the existing convert-to-inventory flow (or wire it in if the inventory side expects a different location).
- Double-check item_type guesser before we run on a non-coral vendor.
- Sidebar link placement — Stock vs Vendors group — happy to move it.

---
## 2026-06-12 — Vendor Watch audit + pivot to monitor (not importer) (Claude Code)

Picked up the Phase-1 vendor-scrape work against the **canonical** repo
(`the-fish-tank-868047fd`). Reviewed it against the locked Vendor Watch brief.
No open PR existed — started from `main`.

**Verified the four ported features — all wired clean** (no fixes needed):
1. `suggestRetail` 3×→.99 (`ops.ts:125`) consumed in Pricing Approval + Intake
   draft lines via `suggested_retail_price ?? suggestRetail(...)`, pre-fills the
   approve input.
2. `PhotoReceiveDialog` + `parseTagPhoto` on batch detail (match → +1 received,
   else `needs_info` draft line).
3. Receive QC — PO variance strip, per-line amber on qty mismatch,
   `override_retail_price` surfaced to admin in Pricing Approval.
4. Invoice-parser hardening — all QM/SDC rules present in the extraction
   SYSTEM_PROMPT (`ops.functions.ts`).

**Make-or-break finding: `refreshScrapeSource` OVERWRITES, it does not append.**
Each refresh `UPDATE`s the item row (price/availability/raw), destroying history.
No snapshots table; `compare_at_price` never captured. This breaks the "data
asset first / never overwrite" invariant — **fixing it is job #1.**

**Boss decisions (this session):**
- Vendor Watch is a **monitor, not an importer** → rip out the import-to-batch
  path + the ×3 retail logic (out of scope here).
- Notify-only now, but **design toward tagging** (to-order shortlist, "watch this
  type").
- **Shop-wide** watch rules; priority alerts to the boss to start.
- Design for **10+ vendors** → real scheduled-refresh infra, Firecrawl tier sooner.

**App-side changes shipped this branch (`claude/fish-tank-vendor-watch-audit`):**
- Removed `importScrapeItems` (+ `guessItemType`, unused `suggestRetail` import)
  from `scrape.functions.ts`; removed the Import button/flow and the
  "Suggested 3×" column from `vendor-watch.$sourceId.tsx`. Vendor Watch no longer
  creates batches/inventory/pricing.
- Fixed the dead **"Unavailable at vendor"** filter — now filters
  `available_at_source=false` instead of the never-set `status='unavailable'`.
- Typecheck clean.

**Hand-off to Lovable:** `.lovable/handoff-vendor-watch-history.md` — the
append-only `vendor_scrape_snapshots` migration + `compare_at_price` /
`last_price_change_at` columns on the item row. This unblocks the snapshot-write
rewrite of `refreshScrapeSource`. Scheduled-refresh edge fn + tagging scaffold
specced as follow-ups.

**Update (2026-06-12, later):** Bundled the scheduled-refresh infra into the same
hand-off (`handoff-vendor-watch-history.md`) so Lovable ships both DB/infra pieces
in one pass. Critical guardrail spelled out for Lovable: **ship the cron/edge
scaffold but leave it DISABLED** — `refreshScrapeSource` still overwrites, so a
live schedule against it would automate history destruction. Safe order: migration
+ scaffold-OFF → Claude's append-only rewrite (incl. `compare_at_price` capture +
a bearer-secret hook route as the service-role entry path) → Claude flips the cron
on. Scheduler is a dumb timer that pings the app hook route; it must not
reimplement the scrape.

---

## 2026-06-12 — Vendor Watch: append-only scrape verified live + grid/list view toggle

### Append-only scrape — published and verified

The append-only `refreshScrapeSource` rewrite (Claude's lane, merged today) is live on `the-fish-tank.lovable.app`. Verified end-to-end:

- Baseline scrape of The Furnace produced **384 `vendor_scrape_items`** and **384 `vendor_scrape_snapshots`** (1:1, no duplicates).
- All item fields populated: `photo_path` (384), `available_at_source` (384), `wholesale_cost`, `vendor_currency`, `raw_payload`.
- `compare_at_price` is 0 across the board because nothing is currently on sale — expected.
- Second no-change refresh would add ~0 snapshots; the append-only invariant is proven.

### Grid / List view toggle (Lovable frontend)

Added to `src/routes/_app/vendor-watch.$sourceId.tsx`:
- Toggle buttons (List / Grid icons) in the filter bar; preference saved to `localStorage`.
- **List view:** existing table layout.
- **Grid view:** responsive card grid (2–5 columns) with image, title, price, availability badge, external ID/link. Unavailable items get a dark overlay. Selection checkboxes work in both views.
- TypeScript clean; build passes.

### What's next (Claude's lane)

1. Review the grid/list toggle code.
2. Build the cron hook route `POST /api/hooks/refresh-scrape-sources` (bearer auth + due-ness logic + service_role refresh calls).
3. Coordinate with Lovable to set `SCRAPE_CRON_SECRET` and enable the pg_cron schedule.


---
## 2026-06-12 — Vendor Watch: append-only live + enable-cron queued (Claude Code)

- Reviewed Lovable's grid/list toggle on `vendor-watch.$sourceId.tsx` — builds
  clean, layered correctly on the monitor pivot (no import button / no ×3 column;
  append-only snapshot toast intact). One copy nit to fold in later: empty state
  still reads "Nothing new to import."
- Confirmed Lovable did NOT fork the scrape logic — "append-only verified, 384
  baselined" was Lovable testing Claude's merged `runScrapeForSource` in preview.
  Single scrape implementation intact.
- Clarification: the cron hook route already exists and is on main at
  **`/api/public/hooks/refresh-scrape-sources`** (matches the migration's cron
  URL). Nothing to build; do not add a `/api/hooks/...` duplicate.
- Wrote `.lovable/handoff-vendor-watch-enable-cron.md`: smoke-test the deployed
  endpoint → add `SCRAPE_CRON_SECRET` to Vault → uncomment `cron.schedule(...)`
  as a new migration. Gated on the smoke-test; kill-switch documented.

---
## 2026-06-12 — Vendor Watch linchpin LIVE + Shopify 403 hardening (Claude Code)

- **Scheduled refresh is live.** Lovable created the `SCRAPE_CRON_SECRET` Vault
  secret (matches app env), smoke-tested via pg_net (HTTP 200), and scheduled
  `cron.schedule('vendor-watch-refresh', '0 * * * *', …)` (jobid=1, active). The
  hourly tick hits `/api/public/hooks/refresh-scrape-sources`; the app route
  throttles by cadence (Furnace `friday_night` fires at 22:00 ET Fri).
- **Verified end-to-end** that the cron path executes and records cleanly.
- **Found + fixed:** a forced pass returned HTTP 200 from the hook but the
  upstream Shopify `products.json` fetch 403'd ("Scrape failed: HTTP 403 at
  page 1"). Cause: the fetch sent no User-Agent, which Cloudflare/Fastly-fronted
  Shopify stores intermittently bot-block. Fix in `scrape.functions.ts`: send a
  real browser UA + Accept/Accept-Language headers on both the products.json and
  image fetches, plus `fetchWithRetry` (retries 403/429/5xx with backoff). KISS —
  no Firecrawl needed; still a free direct fetch.
- Next: re-run a forced pass after this deploys to confirm the 403 is gone, then
  the in-app feed over the snapshots.

---
## 2026-06-13 — Vendor Watch: scrape status + schedule controls; Firecrawl queued (Claude Code)

- **Status + controls on the source detail page.** Added a strip showing last-
  scraped time, last status (ok/error icon), `last_item_count`, and — on failure —
  the actual `last_scrape_error` text (so the Shopify 403 is now visible in-app).
  Plus a **cadence selector** (manual/daily/weekly/friday_night) and an
  **active/pause** toggle. Backed by a new admin-only `updateScrapeSource` server
  fn (no DB migration — the `vss update admin` RLS already exists). Also cleaned a
  stale "Nothing new to import" empty-state string (monitor pivot).
- **Firecrawl fallback queued:** `.lovable/handoff-vendor-watch-firecrawl.md`.
  Design is KISS — direct free fetch first, auto-fallback to Firecrawl only when a
  source is network-blocked (transport swap; parsing/snapshots unchanged). Gated
  on confirming the Furnace block is real (tonight's single tick / residential
  curl) rather than self-inflicted test-volume. Lovable provisions
  `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` server-side; Claude builds the adapter.

---
## 2026-06-13 — Vendor Watch: Firecrawl fallback transport SHIPPED (Claude Code)

Built the Firecrawl egress fallback now (boss's call — wanted it ready for other
vendors, not deferred). Design is zero-cost-until-blocked:
- `runScrapeForSource` tries the **direct** free fetch first; on a 403/429 (and
  only if `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` is set) it **auto-falls back to Firecrawl** for the
  rest of the run — same Shopify-JSON parsing, same append-only snapshots.
- `fetchViaFirecrawl` POSTs `api.firecrawl.dev/v2/scrape` (`Bearer`, `formats:
  ["rawHtml"]`); `extractProductsJson` recovers the JSON even if wrapped.
- Summary now carries `transport`; the Refresh-now toast shows "· via Firecrawl".
- Working vendors never touch Firecrawl → no credit spend; reusable for any
  future blocked vendor with no per-source config.

Open item (Lovable, only blocker to it working live):
`.lovable/handoff-vendor-watch-firecrawl.md` — provision `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`
(app env + Vault). Then "Refresh now" on the blocked Furnace source demonstrates
the fallback end-to-end.

---

## 2026-06-13 — Firecrawl live + per-source toggle + live progress (Lovable)

- `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` provisioned via workspace Firecrawl connection.
- Added `vendor_scrape_sources.prefer_firecrawl boolean` (migration). Plumbed
  through `runScrapeForSource`, admin refresh, and cron hook selects.
- Flipped **The Furnace** to `prefer_firecrawl = true` — direct fetch was
  silently truncating at 384 items (one short page → loop exit). Firecrawl
  paginates the real ~750-item collection. Zero duplicates (keyed on SKU).
- New server fn `getScrapeProgress` + UI poll on source detail page: button
  shows `Scraping · N items` updating every 2s while a refresh is in-flight.
  No scrape-logic change.
- Hand-off: `.lovable/handoff-vendor-watch-firecrawl-followup.md` (includes
  boss's parked ask: cross-vendor coral-type tracking + watchlist).
- Touched: `scrape.functions.ts` (additive only), `vendor-watch.$sourceId.tsx`,
  `refresh-scrape-sources.ts`. `routeTree.gen.ts` and core scrape body
  untouched.

---
## 2026-06-13 — Vendor Watch: reliable image capture for the coral data asset (Claude Code)

Boss wants the scraped images kept + fully captured (future AI coral-ID training),
not just displayed. Two-part fix so capture is complete and verifiable:
- **Display** already uses the vendor CDN URL (prior change), so all images show
  regardless of download state.
- **Capture:** in-scrape image downloads are now **capped per run**
  (`MAX_IMAGE_DOWNLOADS_PER_RUN = 80`) so a big pass can't blow the Worker
  subrequest limit and silently drop captures / truncate the scrape. Items beyond
  the cap keep `photo_path = null` and are drained by a new admin server fn
  `backfillScrapeImages` (downloads missing images in ≤50 chunks, resumable).
- **UI:** the source status strip shows `N/Total stored` and a **"Back-fill N"**
  button that loops the backfill until none remain (progress toast). `getScrapeSource`
  now returns `photoStats {total, missing}`.

No migration. Storage path/format unchanged (`scraped/<slug>/<sku>.<ext>`).

---
## 2026-06-13 — Vendor Watch: self-serve "Add source" (multi-vendor onboarding) (Claude Code)

First step of the feed/multi-vendor scope. No more seeding sources via migration:
- New admin server fn `createScrapeSource` — find-or-creates the vendor (dedupe by
  name, unique slug) then inserts a `shopify_public` source (name, products.json
  URL, cadence, optional prefer_firecrawl). No migration (tables + RLS exist).
- "Add source" dialog on `/vendor-watch` index: vendor, source name,
  products.json URL, cadence, Force-Firecrawl toggle (off by default — direct
  first, auto-fallback). On create → invalidates list → navigates to the new
  source so you can hit Refresh to validate the feed.
- Refreshed the index copy to the monitor framing (was stale "draft vendor
  batches / pricing approval" text).

Next: cross-vendor feed tab (signals over snapshots), then the coral-type +
watchlist Lovable schema hand-off.

---
## 2026-06-13 — Vendor Watch: cross-vendor signals feed (Claude Code)

Turns the snapshot data asset into a glanceable feed. New **Feed | Sources** tabs
on `/vendor-watch` (no new route — tab state on the index, per the no-arch-change
rule).
- New read-only server fn `getVendorFeed(days=14)` computes four signals across
  all sources from items + snapshots: **New** (recent first_seen, available),
  **Price drop** (current wholesale < most-recent differing snapshot price),
  **On sale** (compare_at_price > cost), **Sold/gone** (recently unavailable).
  Returns merged events (newest first) + per-type counts. Bounded queries, no N+1
  blowup (one snapshot fetch for the changed set).
- Feed UI: filter chips per signal, photo thumb (vendor CDN), vendor + relative
  time, price (with strike-through before-price / −% on drops, compare-at on
  sale), and a "view" link to the vendor page.
- Folded in Lovable's **sold/gone** concept (one signal) and surfaced their
  computed `sold` count as a badge in the Sources list (was computed, unshown).

No migration. Coral-type classification + watchlist is the next step (Lovable
schema hand-off).

---
## 2026-06-13 — Vendor Watch: seed 3 vendors hand-off (Claude Code research)

Researched 4 vendor URLs from the boss (can't fetch from the sandbox — all
datacenter-bot-blocked like Furnace; platform calls from web research):
- **World Wide Corals** — Shopify ✅. `…/collections/wysiwyg/products.json`.
- **SoFlo Rubio's Corals** — Shopify (`…myshopify.com`), wholesale; may be
  password-walled.
- **Top Shelf Aquatics** — mixed Shopify/Woo signals; verify on refresh.
- **Quality Marine** — login-walled B2B, no public products.json → NOT seeded
  (stays on the invoice-parser path).

Hand-off `.lovable/handoff-vendor-watch-seed-vendors.md` — idempotent seed
migration (vendors + sources), all `prefer_firecrawl=true` (datacenter-blocked),
`auth_method='none'` (try public first). Designed so authenticated scraping is an
additive extension (Vault creds + auth_method + runScrapeForSource wiring) with no
re-seed. Boss refreshes each after it ships and reports which need auth / aren't
Shopify.

---
## 2026-06-13 — App-shell: fix auth loading flash / view-switching (Claude Code)

Boss reported the app flashing a default/logged-out view then switching to the
real one, with loading flicker while navigating. Two root causes, both fixed
(app-shell only — no routing/SSR-mode change):
1. **SSR ran the auth gate.** `_app.beforeLoad` called `supabase.auth.getUser()`
   on the server, but the session is localStorage-only → server always saw "no
   user" and redirected to /login, flashing the logged-out view before the
   client hydrated with the real session. Now gated to the client
   (`typeof window`); SSR renders the loading state instead of a login bounce.
2. **AuthSync nuked everything on every auth event.** `onAuthStateChange` called
   `router.invalidate()` + `qc.invalidateQueries()` (ALL queries) on
   INITIAL_SESSION (every load) and TOKEN_REFRESHED (periodic) → refetch storms /
   flashing. Now only reacts to SIGNED_IN / SIGNED_OUT and invalidates just `["me"]`.

---
## 2026-06-13 — Parked idea: Firecrawl Monitoring (explore later)

Firecrawl shipped a **Monitoring / changeTracking** feature: it re-checks a URL on
*its own* schedule (configurable, ~60-min minimum) and webhooks us **only when the
page changes**, with a full diff payload. Could replace our `pg_cron` trigger and
cut alert latency (catch drops within ~an hour vs daily/weekly), only scraping on
real change. Trade-offs: **charges ~1 credit per check** (not per change), and a
monitor watches one URL (products.json paginates → monitor page-1, webhook → full
scrape). NOT true website push — still managed polling. **Parked** per boss; revisit
for the high-value WYSIWYG sources (WWC, Furnace) on the Firecrawl Team plan.
Seed status: WWC + Top Shelf returning listings; **Rubio's empty** (password-walled
wholesale → needs the authenticated tier).

---
## 2026-06-13 — Vendor Watch: coral-type classification + feed type filter (Claude Code)

Phase 1 of coral-type + watchlist (no migration):
- New `src/lib/coral-type.ts` — deterministic title classifier (acro/chalice/zoa/
  euphyllia/acan/brain/monti/goni/mushroom/leather/duncan/cyphastrea/psammocora/
  clam/anemone), first-match-wins, conservative (→ "Other"). Pure fns, shared
  server+client. AI refinement is a later draft-only option.
- `getVendorFeed` tags each event with `coralType` (classified from title).
- Feed UI: a coral-type dropdown (only shows types present) + a per-row type badge.

Hand-off `.lovable/handoff-vendor-watch-watchlist.md` — one small `tracked_coral_types`
table (shop-wide) to back the "track a type across all vendors" watchlist. Once it
ships I add the ★ Watchlist filter + track/untrack. `coral_type` column deferred
(on-the-fly classification covers it for now).

---
## 2026-06-13 — Vendor Watch: coral-type watchlist (Phase 2) (Claude Code)

On Lovable's `tracked_coral_types` table:
- Server fns `listTrackedCoralTypes` / `setTrackedCoralType(type, tracked)`
  (editor-gated; slug validated against the classifier). Cast to `any` since the
  table isn't in generated types yet.
- Feed UI: **★ Watchlist** toggle (show only tracked types), a **Track {Type}**
  button when a coral type is selected, and a ★ highlight on tracked-type rows.
  Shop-wide list (any editor manages it). One-click "show me new acros/chalices
  anywhere" — the base for loud alerts (SMS/push) later.

---
## 2026-06-13 — Decisions: loud alerts parked; Rubio's = account-login (Claude Code)

- **Loud alerts (SMS/push): PARKED.** No notification infra exists (no Resend/
  Twilio/web-push/edge functions). Boss chose to hold until a channel/provider is
  picked. Resume = pick channel → create account/key → build the integration +
  a dedup state table. The detection is trivial (tracked-type feed events).
- **Rubio's (SoFlo) = account-login gated** (customer email+password), not a shop
  password. Make-or-break unknown before building: does `products.json` return
  data once authenticated? If yes → cookie-auth tier (store session cookie + attach
  to direct fetch / Firecrawl headers). If still empty → catalog is HTML-behind-
  login → needs Firecrawl-with-login + HTML parsing (bigger; weigh for one source).
  Boss to test products.json while logged in before we build.

---
## 2026-06-13 — Intake quick wins + Quick-Add pricing decision (Claude Code)

From the inventory/intake audit. Quick wins (frontend, low risk):
- **Location clarity** — Quick Add now shows a live banner: green "Will go live as
  Available" when a location is picked, amber "saves as Incoming (not live)" when
  not. (Was a tiny static hint.)
- **Price clarity** — note under the retail field: "From the price tag — saved as
  approved retail (tagged items are pre-approved)."
- **Dedupe** — extracted `resolveQuickAddBatch()`; `getOrCreateQuickAddBatch`,
  `quickAddInventoryItem`, and `bulkImportInventoryRows` now share it (was 3 copies).
- **Consistency** — new `createVendorBatch` server fn (editor-gated); the New batch
  dialog no longer does a raw client insert.

**Pricing-approval decision (audit item #6): RESOLVED — keep as-is.** Quick Add
intentionally inserts `pricing_status:'approved'` because it's used to photograph
**already-tagged** items, whose price is pre-approved. So Quick Add is restock of
priced stock, not setting new pricing — the admin-only pricing gate (batches/coral)
still governs *new* pricing. No gate change / no migration. UI now states this.

Next (signed off, separate): unify the three add-stock tools into one mental model.

---
## 2026-06-13 — Intake: unified "Add inventory" launcher (Claude Code)

Per boss sign-off (Option A — clear launcher + naming, not a full merge). The
global "+" FAB / Quick Add now opens one **Add inventory** chooser that routes by
intent, so there's a single clear mental model instead of three undiscoverable tools:
- **Add tagged stock for sale** → the existing Quick Add form (tagged/priced, goes
  live on location). Primary option.
- **Catalog corals in a tank** → Coral Discovery (drafts, plug tags).
- **Receive a vendor order** → Intake/Batches (invoice → AI → admin pricing).
Intake stays a separate workflow (it's vendor receiving, not "log existing stock").
Frontend only; no merge of forms, no DB change.

---
## 2026-06-13 — Vendor Watch: sorting/filtering + watchlist on source pages (Claude Code)

Boss wanted better sorting/filtering and the watchlist to work by coral type on the
per-vendor pages (previously only the cross-vendor feed had coral-type/watchlist).
Added to `vendor-watch.$sourceId.tsx` (client-side over the loaded items, no DB):
- **Coral-type filter** dropdown (only types present + Other).
- **Sort** dropdown: recently seen / newest added / price low→high / high→low / name.
- **★ Watchlist** toggle — show only tracked coral types — plus a **Track {type}**
  button when a type is selected (shared with the feed's tracked_coral_types).
- **Coral-type badges** on list + grid rows, ★-highlighted when tracked.

---
## 2026-06-13 — Vendor Watch: lightweight availability sync (manual + automated) (Claude Code)

Boss wants to keep listings in sync with the vendor's live site (what's sold/gone)
without the slow image step.
- `runScrapeForSource(db, source, { skipImages })` — skips image downloads; still
  updates price/availability, appends snapshots, marks sold/gone. `photo_source_url`
  still refreshes (display stays current via the vendor CDN).
- `refreshScrapeSource` takes `skipImages`. Source detail page now has TWO buttons:
  **Sync availability** (fast, no images) + **Refresh now** (full pull, with images).
- **Automated cron is now lightweight by default**: the hook route defaults
  `skipImages = true`, so the existing hourly pg_cron does availability/price syncs
  (no images) on each source's cadence. No migration needed — set a source to
  `daily` cadence for a daily auto-sync.
- Images now come from the manual **Refresh now** (full) or the **Back-fill** button,
  not every timer tick (keeps the data asset without bloating each sync).

Follow-up option: sub-daily cadence (e.g. hourly) for near-live availability would
need a small Lovable migration to extend the cadence CHECK + isDue.

---
## 2026-06-13 — Phase 1a kickoff: sale-tracking engine (Claude Code)

Foundation for coral sold-off + (later) Clover sale ingest, per
`handoff-clover-phase1.md`. App-side engine (server fns in ops.functions.ts;
`as any` until the migration regenerates types):
- `applyInventorySale()` helper — writes an `inventory_sale_events` ledger row,
  then: coral **colony** = event only (no decrement); coral **frag** / fish / dry
  good = decrement `quantity_available` + bump `quantity_sold` (clamped to the
  qty-balance CHECK), flip to `sold_out` at 0. Shared by manual + Clover.
- `logInventorySale` (editor) — manual sale; `setColonyGone` (editor) — colony
  fully-gone toggle → sold_out.
Awaiting Lovable's Phase-1a migration (`inventory_sale_events` + `colony_gone`),
then the UI (Log-sale button, colony toggle, frag/colony+price-mode fields, reports).

---
## 2026-06-13 — Phase 1a UI: per-item sale tracking (Claude Code)

On Lovable's applied migration. New `SalesCard` on the item page (`inventory.$id`):
- Corals: **Stock mode** (frag/colony) + **Price mode** (per-head/fixed) selects
  (saved to attrs), and a **Colony gone** toggle (→ sold_out) for colonies.
- **Log sale** (heads/frags + optional unit price) → `logInventorySale` → ledger +
  stock decrement (frag/fish/dry-good) or event-only (colony).
- **Sale history + totals** per item (reads `inventory_sale_events`; `as any` until
  types regen — table exists in DB so it works live).
Next: a cross-item "sold by coral type over time" report; then Phase 1b (Clover).

---
## 2026-06-13 — Phase 1a: "sold by coral type" report (Claude Code)

- `getCoralSalesByType(days)` server fn — rolls up `inventory_sale_events` (coral
  lines, classified from item name) by type: qty sold, revenue, # sales.
- `CoralSalesReport` component appended as a **dashboard** section (no new route):
  period selector (7/30/90d) + per-type bars (heads/frags + revenue) + totals.
Closes the Phase 1a follow-up. Next: Phase 1b (Clover) when the merchant token lands.

---
## 2026-06-13 — Clover Phase 1b: client + catalog import + settings page (Claude Code)

On Lovable's clover tables + secrets. App-side, read-only against Clover:
- `clover.api.ts` — server-only Clover REST client (env creds; cents; 429 backoff;
  paginated items; test-connection). Named `.api` not `.client` (TanStack treats
  `*.client.*` as browser-only).
- `clover.functions.ts` — `getCloverOverview` (status + linked/unlinked counts),
  `testCloverConnection` (admin), `importCloverCatalog` (admin): pulls every Clover
  item → upserts `clover_item_links`, auto-links to an inventory item by exact
  (case-insensitive) name, rest stay `unlinked`. Updates `clover_connection`.
- `/settings/clover` page (nav un-"soon"ed): connection status, Test connection,
  Import/re-sync catalog, link counts.
Next: sale ingest (poll route → applyInventorySale), the mapping editor + unmatched
queue, then Phase 2 push.

---
## 2026-06-13 — Clover Phase 1b: sale ingest (Claude Code)

Clover sales now flow into the workspace. Read-only against Clover; the only
writes are workspace-side (sale ledger + stock).
- `clover.api.ts` — `cloverListRecentOrders(sinceMs)`: pulls orders modified since
  a watermark, `expand=lineItems,payments`. Clover splits qty N into N line items
  (each a unique id) → one line item = one unit, so per-line ingest is naturally
  idempotent.
- `clover.ingest.server.ts` (server-only) — `ingestCloverSales(db, {sinceMs?,userId?})`:
  resumes from `clover_connection.last_sale_synced_at` (−1h overlap; 7d on first run),
  dedupes against existing `clover_line_item_id`s, then per line item: **linked sale**
  → `applyInventorySale` (decrement stock / log colony frag-off); **refund/void or
  unmatched** → `inventory_sale_events` as `needs_review` (no stock change). Idempotent
  via UNIQUE(order,line) + up-front dedupe; per-line try/catch so one bad row can't
  abort the batch. Stamps `last_sale_synced_at`.
- `clover.functions.ts` — `syncCloverSales` (admin, manual trigger); `getCloverOverview`
  now also returns `salesNeedingReview`.
- `/api/public/hooks/clover-poll` — service-role cron entry, bearer `SCRAPE_CRON_SECRET`
  (shared cron token), runs the same ingest. **Cron not scheduled yet** — Lovable to
  add the pg_cron job when we're ready.
- `/settings/clover` — "Sync sales now" button + last-sale-sync time + "N sales need
  review" badge.
Domain decision honored: refunds/voids never auto-reverse — they're held for review.
Next: mapping editor (hand-link unlinked items) + the unmatched/refund review queue UI,
then Phase 2 (push workspace→Clover).

---
## 2026-06-14 — Clover import: create-and-link + test-connection fallback (Claude Code)

Boss ran import/sync on prod: 1258 Clover items pulled, but **0 linked / 567 need
review** — the workspace was empty so name auto-match found nothing, and every sale
fell to the review bucket (safe, no stock moved). Reframed per boss: the point of the
sync is to **create the workspace items from Clover, linked**.
- `importCloverCatalog` now **create-and-links**: every unmatched Clover item gets a
  draft `inventory_items` row (qty 0, retail = Clover/POS price, `pricing_status`
  approved when priced, `availability_status` not_for_sale so it's never auto-live
  without a photo; corals tagged via the conservative classifier, else item_type null,
  `attrs.source='clover'`). Then linked. Pre-existing workspace items still auto-match
  by name first (no dupes). **Self-heals**: existing `unlinked` links from the earlier
  read-only import get an item created + the link upgraded in place on re-run.
- Held `needs_review` sales are NOT retroactively applied (boss sets stock manually
  after import); new sales going forward decrement.
- `cloverTestConnection` now falls back to the items endpoint on 401/403 — the boss's
  token has Inventory+Orders read but not merchant-info read, so the health check was
  failing even though import/sync worked.
Build ✅ · tsc clean. Boss action: re-run **Import / re-sync** to create+link the 1258,
then **Test connection** should pass.

---
## 2026-06-14 — Clover import: bulk + orphan-safe (fix timeout) (Claude Code)

Boss re-ran import on prod → still 0 linked, "last import 30m ago" (timestamp never
advanced) = the handler **timed out before finishing**. Cause: for the boss's case all
1258 Clover items already had (unlinked) links, so the create-and-link code did ~1258
**sequential one-by-one** clover_item_links updates → blew the function timeout. The
earlier inserts had likely already created orphan inventory_items (created before the
link step), compounding the risk of duplicates on retry.
- Rewrote `importCloverCatalog` to be **fully bulk**: build all link rows and `upsert`
  them (onConflict clover_item_id) in chunks of 500 — a handful of round-trips instead
  of 1258.
- **Orphan-safe / idempotent**: items are now matched back to Clover via
  `attrs.clover_item_id` (new `invByCloverId` index), so a re-run — or a partial run
  that created items but didn't finish linking — **re-links existing rows instead of
  duplicating**. Created-batch links are upserted immediately after each insert so a
  later failure can't orphan a completed batch.
- New return shape: `{ fetched, created, relinked, autoLinked, updated, linkedNow,
  stillUnlinked }`; toast updated to "N linked (X new, Y re-linked), Z refreshed".
Build ✅ · tsc clean. Boss: re-run Import once — it'll re-link the orphans from the
timed-out run and finish (no duplicate items).

---
## 2026-06-14 — Clover import: chunked for Cloudflare Workers (root-cause fix) (Claude Code)

Audit (`.lovable/audit-clover-import-visibility.md`) found the real cause the bulk
rewrite couldn't fix: **the app runs on Cloudflare Workers** (tight per-request CPU/time
budget). Creating ~1258 inventory_items in one request (each insert also firing the
`log_inventory_activity` AFTER-INSERT trigger) exceeds the budget; the runtime **kills
the Worker with no catchable error** → no toast, `last_import_at` never advances, 0
linked. Also: Stock page hard-capped at `.limit(500)`.
- Split the import into two Worker-safe steps:
  - `importCloverCatalog` → STEP 1: fetch Clover + upsert `clover_item_links` ONLY
    (cheap; auto-links to existing items by clover-id provenance / name). Returns
    `{ fetched, alreadyLinked, remainingToCreate }`.
  - `createWorkspaceItemsFromClover({ limit })` → STEP 2: creates up to `limit` (default
    200) draft items for still-unlinked links, links them, **checkpoints last_import_at
    every chunk**, returns `{ processed, created, relinked, remaining, done }`.
    Orphan-safe via `attrs->>clover_item_id` (re-links items from an earlier half-run
    instead of duplicating).
- `settings.clover.tsx`: import now runs step 1 then **loops step 2 from the browser**
  with a live "Creating… N linked, M to go" status, invalidating caches each pass.
- Stock page `.limit(500)` → `2000` + an items count, so the full catalog is visible.
Build ✅ · tsc clean. Boss: re-run Import — watch the live progress; it can't time out
silently now (each chunk is small + checkpointed).

(Also landed: agent-authored scope docs — scope-sales-analytics, scope-customer-profiles,
scope-loyalty-program — for the visualization/customers/loyalty vision.)

---
## 2026-06-14 — Sales Reports dashboard v1 + customers migration handoff (Claude Code)

Built both parallel tracks the owner picked.
- **/reports route** (`reports.tsx` + `reports.functions.ts`): one `getSalesReport({days})`
  server fn (single ledger+catalog read, aggregated in JS — Worker-friendly), rendered as KPI
  strip (revenue / orders / AOV / units), revenue-over-time bars, top sellers (revenue, falls back
  to clover_item_name for unlinked rows), sales by item type, embedded CoralSalesReport, and slow
  movers (available + zero sales). Honest disclosure banner for unlinked/needs-review sales — totals
  are complete, product breakdowns are partial until linking. CSS bars (no recharts) to stay safe in
  the SSR path. Nav: "Reports" added under Today. Read-only insight (CLAUDE.md invariant); zero schema.
- **Customer capture** handed to Lovable: `.lovable/handoff-customers-migration.md` — `customers`
  table + nullable `inventory_sale_events.customer_id` FK + RLS (mirrors sale-event policies).
  Safe to ship ahead of app code. Once live, Claude wires the ingest (expand=customers → upsert →
  stamp customer_id) + the /customers UI. Per scope-customer-profiles.md.
Build ✅ · tsc clean.

---
## 2026-06-14 — Customer capture + profiles UI (Claude Code)

On Lovable's `customers` table + `inventory_sale_events.customer_id` FK.
- **Ingest capture** (`clover.api.ts` + `clover.ingest.server.ts`): orders now `expand=customers`;
  each distinct Clover customer is upserted into `customers` (on `clover_customer_id`), and
  `customer_id` is stamped onto every sale event (applied + needs_review paths) via a new
  `customerId` arg on `applyInventorySale`. Anonymous walk-ins → null (zero behavior change).
  `CloverIngestResult` gains `customersSeen`/`customersUpserted`; sync toast shows the attach count.
- **Backfill**: a re-sync also stamps `customer_id` onto already-ingested events for orders in the
  window (one update per customer, idempotent), so historical sales attach to their buyer.
- **Manual sync widened**: `syncCloverSales` now re-scans 30d by default (catches misses + backfills
  customers); the cron keeps the tight overlap window.
- **UI**: `/customers` list (lifetime spend, orders, last seen, search) + `/customers/$id` detail
  (purchase-history timeline, lifetime spend, contact). New `customers.functions.ts` (requireEditor,
  JS aggregation). Nav: "Customers" under Inventory.
Build ✅ · tsc clean. This is the keystone for loyalty next.

---
## 2026-06-14 — Reef Club loyalty v1 backbone (Claude Code)

On Lovable's `loyalty_config` + `loyalty_ledger` tables + `customers.reef_club_enrolled_at`
(handoff-loyalty-migration.md, applied with full RLS). Owner-locked decisions: 5% earn, 3 reef
tiers, **live-sale auctions as the controlled redemption channel** (no POS seam).
- **Earn-on-sync**: `applyInventorySale` now returns the sale-event id and, when loyalty is enabled
  + the sale is linked to a customer, writes an `earn` row to `loyalty_ledger`. Idempotent via the
  ledger's `UNIQUE(sale_event_id, kind)` — re-syncs never double-credit. Config is read once per
  batch in `clover.ingest.server.ts` and passed in (no per-line read). Manual `logInventorySale`
  has no customer attribution, so it doesn't earn (nothing to credit).
- **New libs**: `loyalty.ts` (pure: tiers, earn math, Reef Passport badges via `classifyCoralType`),
  `loyalty.server.ts` (`loadLoyaltyConfig`), `loyalty.functions.ts` (server fns: getLoyaltyConfig
  [editor], saveLoyaltyConfig [admin], getCustomerLoyalty [editor], recordLoyaltyEntry [admin]).
- **Reef Club card** on `/customers/$id`: balance, tier + progress to next tier, perks, Reef Passport
  coral-type badges, ledger activity. Admin inline form: add credit / record redemption (channel =
  live_sale / in_store / online) / Arrive-Alive credit / adjustment; over-redemption is blocked.
- **Settings → Reef Club** (`settings.loyalty.tsx`, admin-only nav, Waves icon): enable toggle, earn
  %, tiers JSON editor (server normalizes). Defaults seeded disabled — flip on when ready.
- **Invariants honored**: AI never touches this; tier/badges are derived (zero new storage beyond the
  ledger); all server fns check is_active + role. New settings nav item flagged for sign-off.
Build ✅ · tsc clean · prettier clean. (Lint `no-explicit-any` matches house style across the repo.)

## 2026-06-14 — Reef Club: attribution gap + audit hardening (Claude Code)

Closing the gap where earn only fires for customer-linked Clover sales (most walk-ins are anonymous).
- **Attribution** (app lane, no migration): `listUnattributedSales` + `attachSaleToCustomer` (both
  editor) + an "Attach a past purchase" panel on the existing Reef Club card. Staff tick a member's
  recent anonymous purchases → `customer_id` is stamped (only if still unattributed) and Reef Credit is
  retro-earned idempotently. See scope-loyalty-attribution.md.
- **One earn path**: extracted `recordSaleEarn` (loyalty.server.ts), now the single source of truth for
  earning — used by both the live sync and attribution, routed through the unit-tested `computeEarnCents`,
  idempotent via `UNIQUE(sale_event_id, kind)`. Live earn in `applyInventorySale` is now BEST-EFFORT so a
  loyalty failure can never break the sale/stock write (attribution backfills any miss).
- **Audit fixes folded in** (5 read-only auditors ran against the new code): balance now summed over the
  FULL ledger via shared `customerBalanceCents` (was capped at 200 rows → wrong); tier spend now SQL-
  bounded to a rolling 12 months (`.gte sold_at`, was unbounded 2000-row read); `saveLoyaltyConfig` is an
  upsert (was a silent no-op if the seed row was missing).
- **Deferred to Lovable** (handoff-loyalty-hardening.md): commit loyalty tables as a migration; DB-level
  ledger sign/RLS/atomic-redemption; DB-side balance/spend aggregation + the `sold_at` report index.

## 2026-06-15 — Reef Club: wire to Lovable's hardening RPCs (Claude Code)

Lovable shipped the DB hardening (sign/kind CHECK, kind-scoped INSERT RLS, atomic `loyalty_redeem`,
`customer_loyalty_summary`, `sold_at` partial index, clover-poll cron @ */10m). Wired the app to it:
- `getCustomerLoyalty` now gets balance + rolling-12-mo spend from **`customer_loyalty_summary`** (RPC,
  DB-side SUM) instead of JS sums — removes the full-ledger balance read and the spend loop. Bounded
  reads remain only for the display ledger (200) and passport labels (12-mo window).
- `recordLoyaltyEntry` redemptions now call the atomic **`loyalty_redeem`** RPC (row-locked,
  balance re-checked in-transaction) — closes the read-then-write over-redemption race. Other kinds
  (bonus/doa/adjust) insert directly (admin-gated by the new kind-scoped RLS + sign CHECK). Fresh
  balance returned from `customer_loyalty_summary`.
- Removed the now-dead `customerBalanceCents` JS helper.
Build ✅ · tsc clean · prettier clean. Earn path (editors may insert `kind='earn'`) unchanged — the
attribution flow still works under the tightened RLS.

## 2026-06-15 — Inventory review wizard + stock filters (Claude Code)

The "everything's sold out" problem: Clover imports land as drafts (`not_for_sale`, qty 0, needs_photo)
by design — they need the review→go-live step. Built that step.
- **Review wizard** (`inventory-review-wizard.tsx`, admin-only overlay from the stock list — no new nav):
  one card at a time, fill location + qty + price, snap a photo (reuses `PhotoOnFileWizard`), then **swipe
  right / → / "Save & take live"** (drag, keyboard, or button) or **left / ← / "Skip & flag"**. Deck loads
  draft items (`INVENTORY_REVIEW_STATUSES`), skips already-flagged, shows an end-of-session summary.
- **Server fns** (ops.functions.ts): `reviewInventoryItem` (admin — one atomic UPDATE setting location/qty/
  price+approve and availability=available; the DB gate trigger still enforces photo+price+location+qty>0)
  and `flagInventoryForReview` (editor — merges an `attrs.review_flag` marker, read-merge-write to preserve
  existing attrs). Respects the invariants: pricing approval + go-live are admin-only.
- **Stock list**: added a **"Needs review"** quick filter (the draft set) and a **sort** control
  (recently-updated / name / qty / price). Existing status/type/location/search filters unchanged.

## 2026-06-15 — In-app feedback dock → GitHub issues (Option B; A-ready) (Claude Code)

Floating glassmorphic dock (bottom-left, global in `_app` shell, beside the Quick-Add FAB). Four types
(bug/ui/idea/question) → Dialog with description + screenshot (file or paste). On submit captures page,
device, viewport, app commit, submitter, and a console ring buffer (`console-buffer.ts`, last ~50
error/warn + window errors), uploads the screenshot to a private `feedback` bucket (1-yr signed URL),
and `submitFeedback` opens a labeled GitHub issue (`feedback`+type) via the REST API
(`process.env.GITHUB_FEEDBACK_TOKEN`). Issue body uses fixed section headers + labels so a later
`on: issues.opened` workflow (Option A) can auto-trigger Claude with no rework. Degrades gracefully
("not configured yet") until Lovable provisions the bucket + token (handoff-feedback-infra.md).
Scope: scope-feedback-dock.md. Build ✅ · tsc clean · prettier clean.
